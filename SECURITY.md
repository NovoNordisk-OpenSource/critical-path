## Reporting a Vulnerability
We do our best to make sure that everything we do is secure, but if we missed something please let us know.

Use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting if you find a vulnerability in this repository. You do that by selecting the Security tab here in GitHub and then click the "Report a vulnerability" button.
